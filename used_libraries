To carry out this project, several tools were needed, such as libraries, all of which are free to use, as indicated below (ALL LIBRARIES ARE FOR WINDOWS):



(computer vision libraries):
Mediapipe: The Mediapipe library is a powerful tool for analysis and processing of data related to computer vision projects. It offers a variety of pre-built solutions for tasks such as hand detection, facial detection, pose tracking, and much more.
cv2 (OpenCV): The cv2 library, also known as OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), is one of the most popular libraries for image processing and computer vision. It provides a wide range of functions to perform operations such as loading images and videos, applying filters, object detection, pattern recognition, camera calibration, and much more.

(mathematical libraries):
(numpy): The numpy library is essential for efficient manipulation of multidimensional arrays and numerical calculations in the Python language. It offers functions to perform mathematical operations on arrays, broadcasting, proportion manipulation, and much more.

(operating system interface and control libraries):
(pycaw): The pycaw library allows interaction with the Windows API for audio control. It's useful for adjusting volume settings of audio devices such as speakers and microphones, as well as for obtaining information about available audio devices.

(how to install?):
Open a terminal or command prompt ("windows") and run the following command:

(Mediapipe): pip install mediapipe
(Opencv): pip install opencv-python
(nump): pip install numpy
(pycaw): pip install pycaw
